# Linked Lists (Part 1) - Complete Guide

## Overview
This comprehensive tutorial series covers fundamental and advanced operations on **Linked Lists**, one of the most important data structures in computer science. Each topic includes detailed explanations and video demonstrations.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Linked List**
Understanding the basics of linked lists, their structure, and how they differ from arrays. Learn about nodes, pointers, and the advantages of dynamic memory allocation.

### 2. **Head & Tail in LL**
Explore the concept of head and tail pointers in a linked list. Understand how these special pointers help in efficient insertion and traversal operations.

### 3. **Add First in LL**
Learn how to insert a new node at the beginning of a linked list. This operation has O(1) time complexity and is one of the most fundamental operations.

### 4. **Add Last in LL**
Master the technique of adding a node at the end of a linked list. Understand the difference between having a tail pointer vs. traversing the entire list.

### 5. **Print a LL**
Implement traversal algorithms to display all elements in a linked list. Learn about iterative approaches to visit each node sequentially.

### 6. **Add in the Middle of LL**
Discover how to insert a node at any position in the linked list. This involves pointer manipulation and proper handling of edge cases.

### 7. **Size of a LL**
Calculate the length of a linked list through iterative or recursive approaches. Understand time complexity considerations.

### 8. **Remove First in LL**
Learn to delete the first node from a linked list efficiently. Handle edge cases like empty lists and single-node lists.

### 9. **Remove Last in LL**
Implement deletion of the last node, which requires traversing to the second-to-last node. Understand why this operation is more complex than removing first.

### 10. **Iterative Search**
Implement linear search in a linked list using iteration. Learn to find elements and return their positions or boolean results.

### 11. **Recursive Search**
Apply recursion to search for elements in a linked list. Compare the recursive approach with iterative methods.

### 12. **Reverse a Linked List**
Master one of the most common interview questions: reversing a linked list. Learn both iterative and recursive approaches.

### 13. **Find and Remove Nth Node from End**
Solve the classic two-pointer problem of removing a node from the end without knowing the list length beforehand.

### 14. **Check if LL is Palindrome**
Implement algorithms to verify if a linked list reads the same forwards and backwards. Use techniques like reversing and comparing.

### 15. **Check if LL is Palindrome (Code)**
Detailed code implementation and optimization of the palindrome checking algorithm with space and time complexity analysis.
